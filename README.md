# Wine-Data-Set-not-Wine-Quality-
Data Analysis using PCA Analysis, K-Means Clustering and Data Classification using SVM 


The aim of this project is that:

-Learning data preprocess (normalization and standarzation)
-Principal Component Analysis on the dataset 
-Applying K-means clustering on the dataset
-Being familiarize sklearn, pandas, matplotlib libraries


Data set and its description can find on this website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine?ref=datanews.io

I had a master degree about Artificial Intelligence at UK in 2020. In our Neural Networks and Machine Learning module, We had this project/assigment to pass the module. 
We did that in MATLAB. I decided to do this assigment in Python to compare and learning differences. When I did it, I understood these Machine Learning Algoirthms
more deeply.  

I am going to plan that Writing this project A Bachelor of Science Degree student can understand smoothly.
